# Grouply

Grouply is a personal project I started to explore full-stack development and create something that fits my own needs.  
The idea is to build a simple yet flexible platform for organizing events, managing participants, and keeping everything related to shared activities in one place.

### Goals
- Strengthen my full-stack skills using **React** and **Spring Boot**
- Develop a real, working application based on my own workflow and ideas  
- Keep learning, experimenting, and improving through hands-on practice

### Status
The project is currently under active development.  
It serves as both a learning experience and a personal exploration of web app design, structure, and functionality.
